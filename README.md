# Obstacle Avoidance Using IOT

## Description

This project focuses on creating an autonomous robot that can navigate and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic distance sensors. The robot uses an Arduino microcontroller for data processing, and its software counterpart to communicate with the robot and send parameters for guiding movement. Three ultrasonic distance sensors provide a wider field of detection.

The robot operates fully autonomously and requires no user intervention during operation. When placed in unknown environments with obstacles, it moves around while avoiding all obstacles with considerable accuracy.

## Features

- The robot detects obstacles using a predetermined threshold distance. - After obstacle detection, the robot can change its course to an alternate path by making an autonomous decision.
- It measures the distance between itself and surrounding objects in real-time. - The robot can operate effectively in varying environments.

## Applications
The technology developed for the robot can be adapted for several uses, such as:
- Surveying landscapes. - Driverless vehicles. - Autonomous cleaning. - Automated lawn mowing. - Industrial supervision.

The robot is not just a technical demonstration but also a useful platform for further development and research in advanced robotics.
